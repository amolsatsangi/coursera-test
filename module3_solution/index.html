To make the section really tall, you can either fill it out with a LOT of text or simply set its height to something like 1000px. It needs to be tall enough to cause scrolling down to be required to view the bottom of the section. Make sure its background color is set to distinguish it from the rest of the content.

                    each Part contains a series of lessons. So, if you ever need
                    reinforcement in a particular area, it will be easy for you to
                    turn to that lesson and re-read it.
                    In Part 1, Success Begins in the Mind, we’ll be focusing on
                    the power of attitude and belief to shape your destiny.
                    You’ll learn how your success initially depends on the way
                    that you THINK.
                    In Part 2, Watch Your Words, we’ll concentrate on the way
                    that you SPEAK... how your attitude is reflected in your
                    words... and how positive language can help to propel you
                    toward your goals.
                    In Part 3, Heaven Helps Those Who Act, we’ll cover the
                    final leg of our journey. Even if you think positively... and
                    speak positively... you won’t achieve your dreams until you
                    ACT. You can’t sit back and just expect success to pay you
                    a visit. In this section, you’ll learn the action steps that will
                    turn your dreams into reality.
                    When you THINK, SPEAK and ACT in ways that support
                    your success, you’re firing on all cylinders... and on the
                    way to achieving phenomenal results in your life.
                    ATTITUDE IS EVERYTHING 10Sam, on the other hand, had entered the coffee shop
                    with a scowl on his face. He looked like he’d been sucking
                    on sour pickles all morning. He was hunched over and
                    tense. His body language cried out “Stay away from me!”
                    He was annoyed when the waitress didn’t take his order
                    immediately. He was annoyed at how long it took for his
                    meal to arrive. He complained about the food, and was
                    furious when he didn’t get his check right away.
                    Why did Sara and Sam have such different experiences
                    in the coffee shop? Remember that each was treated in
                    exactly the same way. It comes down to this: Sara sees the
                    world with a positive attitude. Sam sees the world with a
                    negative attitude.A Definition Of Attitude
                    Think of your attitude as the mental filter through which
                    you experience the world. Some people see the world
                    through the filter of optimism (the glass being half full)
                    while others see life through a filter of pessimism (the glass
                    being half empty). Let me give you some examples to
                    explain the difference between a positive attitude and a
                    negative attitude.
                    The person with the negative attitude thinks “I CAN’T.”
                    The person with the positive attitude thinks “I CAN.”
                    13 ATTITUDE IS EVERYTHING
                    Attitudes are a
                    secret power working
                    24 hours a day,
                    for good or bad.
                    — Unknown
                    The person with the negative attitude dwells on problems.
                    The person with the positive attitude concentrates on
                    solutions.
                    The person with the negative attitude finds fault with
                    others.
                    The person with the positive attitude looks for the good
                    in others.
                    The person with the negative attitude focuses on what’s
                    missing.
                    The person with the positive attitude counts his or her
                    blessings.
                    The person with the negative attitude sees limitations.
                    The person with the positive attitude sees possibilities.
                    I could go on and on with examples, but I’m sure you
                    get the idea. When I talk to audiences about attitude, I
                    often like to use word pictures. They help people to understand
                    and remember what I said. Let me paint this picture
                    for you: Your attitude is your window to the world.
                    Everyone Starts With A Clean Mental
                    Window
                    Let’s take a few moments to discuss
                    why I say that your attitude
                    is your window to the world.
                    We all start out in life with a
                    good attitude — or, should I say,
                    a clean mental window. Just
                    watch young children. They’re
                    always laughing and giggling.
                    They have a sunny disposition.
                    They love to explore new things.
                    Consider the attitude of a child who’s learning to walk.
                    When he stumbles and falls down, what does he do? I’ll
                    tell you what he doesn’t do. He doesn’t frown or blame the
                    carpet. He doesn’t point fingers at his mother or father for
                    giving him lousy instructions. He doesn’t quit. Oh, no. But then, by the grace of God, I learned that all I had to do
                    was clean off my window! I had to improve my attitude so
                    I could see the world clearly again. After I removed the
                    grime from my window, a whole new world opened up for
                    me. The frustration and depression lifted. I had more confidence.
                    For the first time in many years, I could see the
                    magnificent possibilities that life had to offer.
                    And I was able to make a career transition and do work
                    that I absolutely love. When you really think about it, I’m
                    in the business of helping people to clean off their windows
                    — to get a better attitude!</p>
